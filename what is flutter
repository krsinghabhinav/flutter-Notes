What is flutter. 

Flutter is a free and open-source framework created by Google that lets you build apps for multiple platforms (like Android, iOS, web, and desktop) using a single codebase. 
It uses the programming language Dart and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets to help developers easily create beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

1. Single Codebase for Multiple Platforms
You write one set of code, and it works for different platforms. You don’t need to write separate code for Android, iOS, etc.

2. Dart Programming Language
Flutter uses Dart, a programming language that’s fast and easy to learn, similar to JavaScript or Java.

3. Widgets
Flutter uses a concept called widgets. Everything you see in a Flutter app (like buttons, text, images) is a widget. Widgets help you design and structure the app.

4. Hot Reload
With hot reload, you can see changes in your app instantly when you edit your code. You don’t need to restart the whole app to see updates, which saves a lot of time.

5. Cross-Platform Development
You can create apps that work on Android, iOS, web, and desktop without needing to write separate code for each.

6. Open Source and Free
Flutter is completely free and open source, which means anyone can use it, contribute to it, or modify it.

7. Beautiful User Interfaces
Flutter comes with a lot of built-in tools to create visually appealing apps. You can easily customize how your app looks using its rich set of widgets.

8. Fast Performance
Flutter apps perform very well because it compiles directly to native code, meaning it runs as fast as apps built specifically for each platform.

Explain in Hinglish ---
Flutter ek open-source framework hai jo Google ne banaya hai, aur iske through aap ek hi codebase ka use karke multiple platforms ke liye apps bana sakte ho, 
jaise Android, iOS, web, aur desktop. Isme Dart programming language ka use hota hai, jo ki ek fast aur efficient language hai. Flutter ke saath aapko bohot 
saare pre-designed widgets milte hain, jinki madad se aap easily beautiful aur responsive user interfaces bana sakte ho.

Flutter ka sabse bada advantage ye hai ki aapko har platform ke liye alag code likhne ki zaroorat nahi hai. Aap ek baar code likhte ho aur wahi 
app alag-alag platforms pe chal sakti hai. Isse development time aur effort dono bachat hai.

Flutter ke kuch key features:

Hot Reload: Aap jab bhi code mein changes karte ho, to aapko apne app ko baar-baar restart karne ki zaroorat nahi hoti.
Changes instantly dikhte hain, jo development speed ko fast bana deta hai.

Widgets: Flutter mein sab kuch widgets ke through build hota hai. Ye widgets highly customizable hote hain, jisse aap apne app ko apne hisaab se design kar sakte ho.
Cross-platform: Ek code likhne ke baad aap usi code se iOS, Android, web, aur desktop apps build kar sakte ho.
